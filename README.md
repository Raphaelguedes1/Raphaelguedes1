**Raphael Guedes**  
SAP Consultant | ABAP Specialist | Utilities Billing Expert

With extensive experience in SAP ABAP and the Billing & Invoice module within SAP IS-U for Utilities, I specialize in delivering solutions that align with regulatory and business requirements. My favorite project, MP1300/25, involved a large-scale adjustment of client billing for those with social tariffs—successfully implementing price scale changes to comply with the Brazilian government's provisional measures.

I hold the certification "Curso SAP Parâmetros fiscais e a Reforma tributária," underscoring my expertise in SAP fiscal parameters and tax reform.

Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming, exploring new places and cities, traveling, watching movies and series, and spending quality time with my family.
